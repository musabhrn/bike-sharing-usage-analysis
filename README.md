# Bike Sharing Usage Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyses transactional data from an online electronics retailer with the aim to:
- Analyse daily bike rental patterns to identify peak and low usage days, and understand how rentals vary over time and by day type
- Examine the impact of weather conditions on bike rental behavior and determine which factors most strongly influence demand
- Explore customer behavior differences between casual and registered users, including their usage patterns, preferred days, and sensitivity to weather changes

**The analysis is presented through a Jupyter Notebook. [View the Jupyter Notebook]()**
